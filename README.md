# XLogger

## Motivation

Have you ever feel that you own so many clothes or shoes that you forget about some of them, only to be surprised when you happen to see them in the deepest corner of the closet? Or when you want to tell your friends about some good wine you bought, but can remember neither where you bought it nor the brand? Well, at least I've been bothered by such situations, a lot.

XLogger is an online application that can be used to log and keep trace of all kinds of stuff a person buys or currently owns. I'm developing this application as a practice, and hopefully can help myself solve some real problems.
